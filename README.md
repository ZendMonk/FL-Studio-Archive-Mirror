### FL Studio Archive Mirror
(for organized Win/FL Studio users)

This little Python script mirrors your *.nfo-assorted FL Studio sample archive as a collection of numerically prefixed directories and symlinks. The hereby created "mirror archive" can then be specified as sample source in any VST (or other third-party program), enabling you to access your samples in Serum, Omnisphere, or even another DAW for that matter, in the exact same order as you would in FL Studio.

How to use:

1. Make a backup of your sample archive!!!
2. Set config values in config.cfg
3. Run the python script

Use at your own risk!
